    "## When should I extend a SageMaker container?\n",
    "\n",
    "You may not need to create a container to bring your own code to Amazon SageMaker. When you are using a framework such as [TensorFlow](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-tensorflow-container), [MXNet](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-mxnet-container), [PyTorch](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-pytorch-container) or [Chainer](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-chainer-container) that has direct support in SageMaker, you can simply supply the Python code that implements your algorithm using the SDK entry points for that framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if there is direct SDK support for your environment or framework, you may want to add additional functionality or configure your container environment differently while utilizing our container to use on SageMaker.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Some of the reasons to extend a SageMaker deep learning framework container are:**\n",
    "1. Install additional dependencies. (E.g. I want to install a specific Python library, that the current SageMaker containers don't install.)\n",
    "2. Configure your environment. (E.g. I want to add an environment variable to my container.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Although it is possible to extend any of our framework containers as a parent image, the example this notebook covers is currently only intended to work with our PyTorch (0.4.0+) and Chainer (4.1.0+) containers.**\n",
    "\n",
    "This walkthrough shows that it is quite straightforward to extend one of our containers to build your own custom container for PyTorch or Chainer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Permissions\n",
    "\n",
    "Running this notebook requires permissions in addition to the normal `SageMakerFullAccess` permissions. This is because it creates new repositories in Amazon ECR. The easiest way to add these permissions is simply to add the managed policy `AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess` to the role that you used to start your notebook instance. There's no need to restart your notebook instance when you do this, the new permissions will be available immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The example\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we show how to package a PyTorch container, extending the SageMaker PyTorch container, with a Python example which works with the CIFAR-10 dataset. By extending the SageMaker PyTorch container we can utilize the existing training and hosting solution made to work on SageMaker. By comparison, if one were to build their own custom framework container from scratch, they would need to implement a training and hosting solution in order to use SageMaker. Here is an example showing [how to create a SageMaker TensorFlow container from scratch](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-examples/blob/master/advanced_functionality/tensorflow_bring_your_own/tensorflow_bring_your_own.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we use a single image to support training and hosting. This simplifies the procedure because we only need to manage one image for both tasks. Sometimes you may want separate images for training and hosting because they have different requirements. In this case, separate the parts discussed below into separate Dockerfiles and build two images. Choosing whether to use a single image or two images is a matter of what is most convenient for you to develop and manage.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're only using Amazon SageMaker for training or hosting, but not both, only the functionality used needs to be built into your container.\n",

    "### An overview of Docker\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're familiar with Docker already, you can skip ahead to the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "For many data scientists, Docker containers are a new technology. But they are not difficult and can significantly simplify the deployment of your software packages. \n",
    "\n",
    "Docker provides a simple way to package arbitrary code into an _image_ that is totally self-contained. Once you have an image, you can use Docker to run a _container_ based on that image. Running a container is just like running a program on the machine except that the container creates a fully self-contained environment for the program to run. Containers are isolated from each other and from the host environment, so the way your program is set up is the way it runs, no matter where you run it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker is more powerful than environment managers like conda or virtualenv because (a) it is completely language independent and (b) it comprises your whole operating environment, including startup commands, and environment variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Docker container is like a virtual machine, but it is much lighter weight. For example, a program running in a container can start in less than a second and many containers can run simultaneously on the same physical or virtual machine instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker uses a simple file called a `Dockerfile` to specify how the image is assembled. An example is provided below. You can build your Docker images based on Docker images built by yourself or by others, which can simplify things quite a bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker has become very popular in programming and devops communities due to its flexibility and its well-defined specification of how code can be run in its containers. It is the underpinning of many services built in the past few years, such as [Amazon ECS].\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon SageMaker uses Docker to allow users to train and deploy arbitrary algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Amazon SageMaker, Docker containers are invoked in a one way for training and another, slightly different, way for hosting. The following sections outline how to build containers for the SageMaker environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some helpful links:\n",
    "\n",

    "### How Amazon SageMaker runs your Docker container\n",
    "\n",
    "Because you can run the same image in training or hosting, Amazon SageMaker runs your container with the argument `train` or `serve`. How your container processes this argument depends on the container. All SageMaker deep learning framework containers already cover this requirement and will trigger your defined training algorithm and inference code.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you specify a program as an `ENTRYPOINT` in the Dockerfile, that program will be run at startup and its first argument will be `train` or `serve`. The program can then look at that argument and decide what to do. The original `ENTRYPOINT` specified within the SageMaker PyTorch is [here](https://github.com/aws/deep-learning-containers/blob/master/pytorch/training/docker/1.5.1/py3/Dockerfile.cpu#L123).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Running your container during training\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, our SageMaker PyTorch container utilizes [console_scripts](http://python-packaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command-line-scripts.html#the-console-scripts-entry-point) to make use of the `train` command issued at training time. The line that gets invoked during `train` is defined within the setup.py file inside [SageMaker Containers](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-containers/blob/master/setup.py#L48), our common SageMaker deep learning container framework. When this command is run, it will invoke the [trainer class](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-containers/blob/master/src/sagemaker_containers/cli/train.py) to run, which will finally invoke our [PyTorch container code](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-pytorch-container/blob/master/src/sagemaker_pytorch_container/training.py) to run your Python file.\n",
    "\n",
    "A number of files are laid out for your use, under the `/opt/ml` directory:\n",

These values are always strings, so you may need to convert them. `resourceConfig.json` is a JSON-formatted file that describes the network layout used for distributed training.\n",
    "* `/opt/ml/input/data/<channel_name>/` (for File mode) contains the input data for that channel. The channels are created based on the call to CreateTrainingJob but it's generally important that channels match algorithm expectations. The files for each channel are copied from S3 to this directory, preserving the tree structure indicated by the S3 key structure. \n",
    "* `/opt/ml/input/data/<channel_name>_<epoch_number>` (for Pipe mode) is the pipe for a given epoch. Epochs start at zero and go up by one each time you read them. There is no limit to the number of epochs that you can run, but you must close each pipe before reading the next epoch.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The output\n",
    "\n",
    "* `/opt/ml/model/` is the directory where you write the model that your algorithm generates. Your model can be in any format that you want. It can be a single file or a whole directory tree. SageMaker packages any files in this directory into a compressed tar archive file. This file is made available at the S3 location returned in the `DescribeTrainingJob` result.\n",
    "* `/opt/ml/output` is a directory where the algorithm can write a file `failure` that describes why the job failed. The contents of this file are returned in the `FailureReason` field of the `DescribeTrainingJob` result. For jobs that succeed, there is no reason to write this file as it is ignored.\n",
    "\n",
